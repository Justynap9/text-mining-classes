Review
Overall excellent experience. The room and bed were very good ambience and facilities also good. Very good location and the staff was GOLD
Very nice and clean place very nice staff who helped us for dinner and called the restaurant in advance
Average hotel with good location. No restaurant. Rooms are a bit smaller than usual 4 stars but not bad. Breakfast is OK
